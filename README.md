# Hello! My name is Julia! :smile:
I'm an Information Systems student at [FIAP](https://www.fiap.com.br/). I also work as an intern with automation at [Itau Unibanco Holding SA](https://www.itau.com.br/). :blue_book:
Since I started college, I became passionate about Python and its usage with data science. :computer:
Recently I've started to research more about the mobile language Dart, and it's framework Flutter. :iphone:
